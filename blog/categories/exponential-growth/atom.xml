    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY">Excellent video lecture</a> from University of Colorado professor Albert Bartlett on the exponential growth function and its real world implications. This should be taught and retaught every year of elementary school through undergraduate education.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, exponential growth occurs anytime an amount increases by n% per t time period. Finance and economics are obvious culprits: 2% inflation per year, 3% economic grown per year, 2% interest on bonds, 20% interest on credit card debt, etc.</p>

<p>The crux of the lecture is that it is easy to calculate the rate at which an amount with constant growth will double: Simply divide 70 by the absolute percent.</p>

<p>For example, GDP growth is 3% per year, how soon till the GDP doubles? 70/3 = 23.3, so 23.3 years until the GDP doubles.</p>

<p>Say population growth is 7% per year, how soon till the population doubles? 70/7 = 10 years.</p>

<p>Say your credit card interest rate is 20%, how soon till the amount you owe doubles? 70/20 = 3.5 years.</p>

<p>This little rule of thumb is immensely useful for interpreting news reports, government proclamations, managing personal finances, and understanding a host of other problems facing the human race over the next century, which Professor Bartlett elaborates on.</p>

<p>Well worth the time to watch it.</p>
