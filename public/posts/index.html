  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/22/bitcoins-intrinsic-value/">Bitcoin&#8217;s Intrinsic Value?</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Yesterday I watched a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/a-look-at-the-world-s-largest-online-currency-cPMjkXT0QB~SWJbQWWaB2g.html">Bloomberg News segment</a> on Bitcoin, which raised a
number of questions about the cryptocurrency.  All of these have been answered
before but the journalists apparently weren&rsquo;t aware of that (except perhaps the host,
Sara Eisen, who seems to have done her homework).</p>




<p>Following are the answers to these questions, as well as some additional, unanswered,
questions and issues the segment could have raised but didn&rsquo;t.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2013/03/22/bitcoin-and-the-byzantine-generals-problem/">Bitcoin &amp; the Byzantine Generals Problem</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Whenever I need to explain what is so special about Bitcoin to someone unfamiliar with it, I explain it in terms of accounting ledgers and the Byzantine Generals Problem.  This is that explanation, so I can just link it to folks instead of having to rewrite it every time.</p>




<p>First, don&rsquo;t think of bitcoin as a currency, but rather as a ledger.  It is an electronic ledger, of which a copy is kept on every participant&rsquo;s computer in the network, and all of which are continually updated, reconciled, and synchronized in real-time.  Every participant can make entries in this ledger, which records transactions of a certain amount of currency from one participant to another participant, and every one of those entries is then propagated to the network in realtime, so that every copy on every computer is updated near simultaneously and all copies of the ledger are kept synchronized.  The official term for this public, distributed ledger is the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Blockchain">&lsquo;blockchain&rsquo;</a> (which <a href="http://blockchain.info/">you can see here</a>), and it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">Bittorrent</a> technology to keep all copies synchronized.</p>




<p>You can also think of Bitcoin not as a currency but as a general solution to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">difficult algorithmic problem</a> in the field of distributed systems, colloquially known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance">Byzantine Fault Tolerance</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Generals%27_Problem">Byzantine Generals Problem</a>, or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem">Two Generals Problem</a>.</p>

<p>Election 2012 is shaping up to be interesting for a variety of reasons, but not least because of two reasons involving forecasting:</p>




<ol>
<li>Sophisticated probabalistic electoral college forecast models first seen in the early-mid 2000s have had a few election cycles to mature and evolve.</li>
<li>This is the first <em>closely contested</em> presidential election since said techniques hit mainstream, and for the first time since then we&rsquo;re seeing disagreement among different forecasting methodologies.</li>
</ol>




<p>There are roughly three categories of data-driven, systematic forecasting methodologies:</p>

<p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show&rsquo;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&rsquo;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&rsquo;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/07/04/the-problems-of-forecasting/">The Problems of Forecasting</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Followup to the <a href="http://expectedpayoff.com/blog/2012/07/04/the-pathology-of-big-data/">previous post</a>.  Nate&rsquo;s <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/the-problems-with-forecasting-and-how-to-improve/">extensive article</a> is too wide-ranging to paraphrase or summarize, but is a great overview of the problems of forecasting.</p>




<p>And some choice followup commentary:</p>




<blockquote><p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/the-problems-with-forecasting-and-how-to-improve/?comments#permid=3">Dan M.Grove</a>, OK
Nate, I really think you overstate your case. I&rsquo;ll give an easy counter-examples to your statement that narrow theories are better than broad theories: the standard model of physics. From it, all weak intereactions and all of quantum electromagnetism can be derived. And classical electromagnitism has been derived from quantum electrodynamics.
These theories have been verified millions of time. They are the basis for our understanding a wide range of technology, from electromagnetism to computers to lasers to quantum optics.
You rightly point out that medical papers are often not reproduced. That is because they only need a 95% confidence level (or 2 sigma) to be published. And, since null results are rarely published, its easy to have 19 random unpublished result, and 1 random published one.
When charm was found, it was published with a 5-sigma statistical signal. It was reproduced immediately. These are broad ranging theories that have been well identifed.
If you want a political science result to be verified, it should be something that isn&rsquo;t just something that can be restated N different ways, that has stable results when you change the question slightly. In particular, it is a big plus for the theory if you offer a skeptical colleauge the right to reset the question and then recomute the results. Then the results should have less than a 1 in 100 chance of being found randomly. 1 in 1000 would be much better.</p>

<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/the-problems-with-forecasting-and-how-to-improve/?comments#permid=3:1">Nate Silver</a>, Brooklyn, NY
Dan,
You make some excellent points. In particular, one of the things I found very problematic when I began to examine the elections &ldquo;fundamentals&rdquo; models is that they were not very robust to small change in assumptions. Replace an economic variable with one that is normally closely correlated with it, and you will get a substantially different result in certain elections.
But I think one needs to be careful about drawing analogies between the physical and the social sciences. One of the things that characterized Tetlock&rsquo;s hedgehogs was that they saw the political system as more analogous to a noncomplex (perhaps even Newtonian) physical system than the foxes did.
This can sometimes cut the other way as well. For instance, there are some criticisms of global warming forecasts that would be reasonably compelling if they were tantamount to social science predictions, but don&rsquo;t work as well when the causality of the greenhouse effect, etc. is relatively well understood (although, I certainly don&rsquo;t claim that global warming forecasts are above criticism or without their problematic elements).
Then again, it&rsquo;s interesting that a lot of Bayesian probability theory really originated with Laplace, who thought that even though the mechanisms understanding the universe were extremely regular, our ability to measure and understand them precisely might not be.</p>

<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/the-problems-with-forecasting-and-how-to-improve/?comments#permid=3:3">Richard</a>, NY
Nate,
I think you are confusing complexity with uncertainty in formulation. The weather/climate system is immensely complex and involves a massive number of interactions and feedbacks. Most of those interactions however are reasonably well understood and can be derived from the laws of physics.
Social science models on the other hand are complex but also subject to fundamental lack of understanding of the basic interactions involved. This manifests itself in the parametric sensitivity you mentioned. Weather models are not subject to anywhere near this degree of parametric uncertainty even though they are proably more complex. Indeed the largest numerical models in the world are weather/climate models.</p>

<p><a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/the-problems-with-forecasting-and-how-to-improve/?comments#permid=3:8">Dan M.Grove</a>, OK
Thanks for your reply Nate. You are absolutely right that facile comparisons between physical sciences and social sciences are extremely dangerous. But, when you included medicine, I wanted to point out that broad statements can have enormous predictive power.
Ecconomics and social sciences are causally dense. So, it is hard to make broad quantitative statements. Still, I don&rsquo;t think that the attempt to make fields like interenational relations more like science by so limiting the scope of one&rsquo;s study to make it barely useful is the answer either. People like Huntington still provided insight, even thought they weren&rsquo;t quantitative.
It&rsquo;s interesting that you mention Laplace because physicists talk about the Laplacian ilusion; since QM shows the inherent indetermancy of physics. Indeed, some measurable properties cannot exist apart from measurement (e.g. electron spin at N degrees).
Finally, while it is hard to make general, robust, high probabability statements in the field of political science, it is not impossible. It&rsquo;s just that most folks in the social sciences, and many in medicine, alas, think they&rsquo;ve done it when they haven&rsquo;t. Part of it is the way statistics are improperly treated. Being one of the first scientists who learned his craft when Monte Carlos were reasonably priced, I understand something of the pitfalls and the ways around them.
So, I agree, most of the supposedly precise general statements in the social sciences aren&rsquo;t&hellip;but a few are.</p></blockquote>

It was while I was working on this that I realized comp sci isn’t about nerdy boys sitting at computers and coding out nonsense that turns into violent video games and complicated math problem solvers. No, comp sci isn’t this at all. Comp sci, as I have found in my classes at Stuy, is a medium for expression, a place for creation and creativity.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/09/a-3d-printer-on-every-desktop-in-every-home/">A 3D Printer on Every Desktop in Every Home</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this post for a while, but Vice-President Biden <a href="http://www.3dprinter.net/joe-biden-plugs-3d-printing-commencement-address">just gave me the kick in the rear to finally get it done</a>.</p>




<p>My mom and dad are wonderful parents who have done a many great things for my sister and I along the way.  One of the most important was that when we were wee little tykes they got us started early with the nascent computer revolution by buying us a series of cutting edge home computers &ndash; Tandy TRS-80, Apple IIc, Apple IIgs, and a series of PCs.  I still remember learning BASIC on the TRS-80 and connecting to the Internet&rsquo;s precursors &ndash; CompuServe, Prodigy, AOL, and random BBS&rsquo;s via fast 56k baud modem.</p>




<p>I don&rsquo;t believe mom and dad were sure exactly what little kids could get out these new devices, but it was no leap of faith to perceive that computers were the way of the way of the future, and getting a head start on the information age was incredibly educational and quite a gift.</p>




<p>The dream of the 70s and 80s Silicon Valley visionaries like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Jack Tramiel (Commodore 64), and others was <em>&ldquo;A computer on every desk in every home&rdquo;</em>.  They achieved it and more &ndash; now it&rsquo;s a computer on every desk, in every backpack, in every pocket and purse, in every corner of the world, from developed to developing nations (well, almost).  And look at how they changed the world.</p>




<p>However, the revolution isn&rsquo;t over, it&rsquo;s just getting started, and the next phase is going to be <em>&ldquo;a factory on every desk in every home&rdquo;</em>.  Or, more specifically <em>&ldquo;A 3D Printer on every desk in every home.&rdquo;</em>  Parents and schools will be buying their kids home 3D printers to go along with their computers, tablets, and smart phones.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/09/how-to-create-real-wealth/">How to Create Real Wealth</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>One of the many problems caused by the ongoing financial crisis is renewed criticisms of the capitalist system in general.  Our current system is deeply flawed and certainly deserves some of it, however there is bathwater and there is the baby, and we conflate the two at the risk of exacerbating the financial crisis rather than mitigating it or preventing a recurrence.</p>




<p><strong>Bathwater</strong> = increasing fragility, instability, and systemic risk; regulatory, institutional, and govermental capture; crony capitalism; privatized profits and socialized losses; too big to fail; increasing financialization of the economy &ndash;> increasing concentration of paper wealth &ndash;> outsourcing of real wealth creation &ndash;> increasing concentration of political power &ndash;> tyranny of the minority, etc.</p>




<p><strong>Baby</strong> = the core mechanic of capitalism &ndash; real wealth creation.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/09/americas-greatest-21st-century-challenge/">America&#8217;s Greatest 21st Century Challenge</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>There is a lot of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4086251">discussion</a> in tech circles recently on the sorry state of US immigration and the dire need for more qualified engineers, computer scientists, matheticians, etc., but much of it misses the bigger picture.  The big picture is that the dominant socioeconomic dynamic of the 21st century will be the competition between the US system and China&rsquo;s massive population (and India&rsquo;s to a lesser extent) for global economic ascendance.</p>




<p>The US population is ~300 million, China&rsquo;s is ~1.2 billion, 4x our size. (India&rsquo;s is over 1 billion and the EU is ~400 million, for comparison).  For every engineer, scientist, genius, etc in the US, there are ~4 in China.  Over the long term the US has no hope whatsoever of competing against that without significant structural changes.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Google+ got a <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2012/04/toward-simpler-more-beautiful-google.html">redesign two months ago</a>.  It&rsquo;s nice, I have no major complaints about the new look (except for the huge whitespace beneath the aside portrait/info, but that&rsquo;s more aestetic than usability).</p>




<p>However, I do have a major complaint about the fundamental functionality.  The problem with G+ is that you can&rsquo;t fine-tune the signal:noise ratio enough.</p>

  <p>
    <p>If you use both <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a> browser and its upstream development version, <a href="http://www.chromium.org/">Chromium</a>, on the same machine, you may, like me, want a way to sync your Bookmarks between the two locally, without using some third party cloud sync/backup service.</p>




<p>Well there&rsquo;s an easy way to do this with a software version control control system like Git, Mercurial, Subversion, etc.  I use Linux and Git, but this technique should work on any operating system with any version control system.</p>

  <p>
    <p>Sun/Oracle Java was <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/67909/how-do-i-install-oracle-jdk-6">removed from Linux distros</a> in 2011 due to licensing issues.<br/>
It can only be downloaded directly from Oracle&rsquo;s website now and installed manually.
There are many different ways of doing that, but for Debian and Debian-derivatives,
I prefer using Debian&rsquo;s excellent <code>update-alternatives</code> tool.</p>

  <p>
    <p><a href="http://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, formerly PLT Scheme, is one of the easiest Scheme programming environments to set up, making it a convenient environment for learners to use to work through all the problems in <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">The Little Schemer</a>. It only needs two modifications after installation:</p>




<ol>
<li><p>Start DrRacket</p></li>
<li><p>Change the language to Module. In the Language menu at the top (or the bottom left):</p>

<p> <blockquote><p>Language &ndash;&gt; Choose Language &ndash;&gt; Module &ndash;&gt; OK</p></blockquote></p></li>
<li><p>DrRacket lacks the primitive <code>atom?</code> used extensively in The Little Schemer, so you have to define it yourself.  atom? simply returns true if the input is an atom, false if not. In the top window, the Definitions window, add:</p></li>
</ol>


<p><figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>(define atom? (lambda (a)  (not (list? a))))</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all, you&rsquo;re ready to start.</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/07/the-complex-costs-of-war/">The Complex Costs of War</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p><a href="http://nancysherman.com/">Nancy Sherman</a> was the first Distinguished Chair in Ethics at the U.S. Naval Academy andis currently University Professor of Philosophy at Georgetown. <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/a-crack-in-the-stoic-armor/?src=me&amp;amp;ref=homepage%22">Her article</a> in the NY Times today discusses the subtle, complex, confusing costs to civilized people tasked to fight our modern wars.</p>




<p>&ldquo;In the military, even those who have never laid eyes on a page of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epictetus">Epictetus</a>, still live as if they have. To suck it up is to move beyond grieving and keep fighting; it is to stare death down in a death-saturated place; it is to face one more deployment after two or three or four already. It is hard to imagine a popular philosophy better suited to deprivation and constant subjection to stressors [than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism">Stoicism</a>].</p>




<p>And yet in the more than 30 interviews I conducted with soldiers who have returned from the long current wars, what I heard was the wish to let go of the Stoic armor. They wanted to feel and process the loss. They wanted to register the complex inner moral landscape of war by finding some measure of empathy with their own emotions.&#8221;</p>

  <p>
    <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-QA2rkpBSY">Excellent video lecture</a> from University of Colorado professor Albert Bartlett on the exponential growth function and its real world implications. This should be taught and retaught every year of elementary school through undergraduate education.</p>




<p>In a nutshell, exponential growth occurs anytime an amount increases by n% per t time period. Finance and economics are obvious culprits: 2% inflation per year, 3% economic grown per year, 2% interest on bonds, 20% interest on credit card debt, etc.</p>




<p>The crux of the lecture is that it is easy to calculate the rate at which an amount with constant growth will double: Simply divide 70 by the absolute percent.</p>




<p>For example, GDP growth is 3% per year, how soon till the GDP doubles? 70/3 = 23.3, so 23.3 years until the GDP doubles.</p>




<p>Say population growth is 7% per year, how soon till the population doubles? 70/7 = 10 years.</p>




<p>Say your credit card interest rate is 20%, how soon till the amount you owe doubles? 70/20 = 3.5 years.</p>




<p>This little rule of thumb is immensely useful for interpreting news reports, government proclamations, managing personal finances, and understanding a host of other problems facing the human race over the next century, which Professor Bartlett elaborates on.</p>




<p>Well worth the time to watch it.</p>

  <p>
    <p><a href="http://Programmingbooks.org">Programmingbooks.org</a> is one of my favorite websites, despite being offline since a failed disk and lack of backup lost the data some time ago. Fortunately, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822052443/http://www.programmingbooks.org/">archive.org preserved it</a>, and the owner intends to get it <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2779740/what-happened-to-programming-books-com">back online sometime soon.</a></p>




<p>Any kind of technical book generally takes longer to read than other books, since you not only have to work through the problem sets to understand the material, but also reread most of it multiple times, either as part of a <a href="http://www.ewrd.com/ewrd/index.asp">speed-reading method</a> or as you review the material while working on the problems.</p>




<p>A site like this one is invaluable in cutting down the time required to find the books most highly regarded among professional programmers, software engineers, and hackers. Additionally, less noise (marginal and non-programming books) than Amazon and more trustworthy reviews provide an essentially industry-certified curriculum that&rsquo;s better than what some schools offer (the <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=diploma%20factory">diploma factories</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diploma_mill">mills</a>, at least).</p>

  <h2><a href="/blog/2012/06/07/advice-to-young-engineer-slash-entrepreneur/">Advice to Young Engineer/Entrepreneur</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    <p>Just reposting a <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1747713">little gem from HackerNews</a>&hellip;</p>




<blockquote><ol>
<li><p> Be good. Be very good. Don&rsquo;t be the &ldquo;front-end guy&rdquo; or the &ldquo;back-end guy&rdquo;, or some other &ldquo;guy&rdquo;. Once you know what you want to build, building software is about five things: algorithms that solve your problem, programming languages that express your algorithms, computer architecture that makes your algorithms run efficiently on real hardware, the practical toolchain, and the management of complexity of real software. So study algorithms, and then graduate algorithms, and then advanced graduate algorithms. Do every challenge problem online. Study programming languages to express those algorithms. You can get away with three: C, Lisp, Haskell. Everything else is crud. Study computer architecture and compilers to see how your programs run efficiently. Learn great tools (Emacs/Vim/Visual Studio/bash/Linux/OS X/Windows whatever &ndash; just great ones that you&rsquo;re damn good at). Learn how complexity is managed. Look at lare open source projects, study how they&rsquo;re organized, and contribute patches to understand how small changes can effect a large system.</p></li>
<li><p> Learn what to build. Once you get really good, your time starts to be more valuable than gold. There will be very few people in the world who are as good (the internet will bias you to think that the world is full of great people &ndash; this ain&rsquo;t so, there isn&rsquo;t enough of &lsquo;em). You owe it to people and to yourself not to bother with improving something by 1% or 10% because you&rsquo;re wasting time in opportunity cost and could be improving something by 1000%. Make sure what you&rsquo;re building is worth building, and make sure every line of code you write is worth writing, otherwise you will fail. Break the NIH syndrome in yourselves now (all good people have it, phenomenal people that build successful companies broke it in themselves). Learn to infer what people want.</p></li>
<li><p> If you&rsquo;re that good, you will easily get a $100k job after graduation (probably more by then), and grow to $180k in a few years. That&rsquo;s very, very comfortable. It&rsquo;s not worth busting your ass 16 hours a day to build another CRM tool when you can have a $180k job. So don&rsquo;t start a business to start a business. Start a business to bring a meaningful change in the world. A huge change. A 1000% change. There are lots of hugely successful companies out there that do what&rsquo;s not meaningful to you &ndash; ignore them. But do make sure that what&rsquo;s meaningful to you is also meaningful to millions (hopefully billions) of others. You won&rsquo;t get rich writing Lisp compilers.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>  This is what matters. Most everything else is fluff.</p></blockquote>

  <p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+use+lisp+with+vim">web is replete</a> with people trying to create, or learn, an efficient workflow for programming Lisp in Vim.  I&rsquo;m the latter.  A vim amateur/intermediate, a Lisp noob.<br/>
I want a quick and easy way to hack Lisp in Vim, save it in a file, load it into the REPL, hack some more in the REPL, and push the file to Github, without having to take the time to learn Emacs and <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a>, or even <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2531">SLIMV</a> (I&rsquo;ll get around to these later after I&rsquo;ve learned the language somewhat).</p>




<p>My solution:  two terminal windows (three if you want one for vcs commits).  One with vim and your code, the second with a REPL, the third with command prompt in your working/project directory for git commits.</p>




<ol>
<li><p>In vim, make your changes and save :w.  Leave the editor open.</p></li>
<li><p>Alt-tab to the REPL terminal, use (load &lsquo;filename.lisp) to reload your code after changing it.</p></li>
<li><p>In the third terminal, add, commit, and push to vcs as necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
